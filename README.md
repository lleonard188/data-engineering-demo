I created this project to learn how different technologies could be used for processing large files in genomics. When complete it will take a file, align it with a reference file, and then find the differences between the two.

This project is written in Scala and uses Apache Spark. It has a CI pipeline that is run by a Kubernetes cluster. The computing infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform.
